For quite some time I have had a couple of wordpress sites published but with not much content. I have been working most of my professional life as a web developer, making sites for clients but never really got down to doing one for myself. Therefore, I ended up with random drafts published on the domains which I bought.<!--more-->

I have worked for a long time with WordPress, which I find to be a great platform for publishing websites of any kind in a quick manner without major infrastructure. It actually started as a purely blog-oriented platform and has evolved into an arguably good CMS for web publishing. It is simple to install and manage and you can get your blog running fairly quickly. There is also a wide array of plugins which you can easily install for free in order to customize your site to your liking.
